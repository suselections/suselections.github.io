											<h1>Kobi Pollard</h1>
											<p>Running for VP Internal</p>
										</header>
                                            <p>
                                                My name is Kobi Pollard and I am currently running in the Science Undergraduate Society elections for the position of Vice-President, Internal. My platform can be found below and if it resonates with you, consider voting for Kobi Pollard for SUS VP Internal.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>Entering the 2020/2021 school year, I want to bring new energy to the portfolio and re-focus on what it truly is about. The internal portfolio allows for the creation of a sense of community within the faculty of Science. As VP internal, I will define the purpose of each committee with respect to this goal so that every committee is working towards enhancing the feel of a science community at McGill. Through collaborations, improving on feedback, and bringing fresh perspectives into the portfolio, I believe in my capabilities of creating a strong science identity within the faculty. 
                                            </p>

                                        <h2>Long Platform</h2>
                                    </header>
                                    <h4>FROSH</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Being the first event at McGill for incoming students, frosh is extremely impactful in setting up the mentality of a science community. This event allows students to meet many others in the faculty and be introduced to McGill. I would want to expand the Montreal Crawl to focus more on introducing students to the Montreal/McGill community by including additional stops that are not drinking/food-related. This would also provide the opportunity for clubs and organizations to run stops without a sponsorship fee. Additionally, I would work with the other internals across faculties to create and promote “chill” night events for each night (expanding on the laser tag currently available). By including and promoting these “chill” events, the incoming students can meet people with similar interests to them, and they become aware that non-intense event options exist at McGill.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>SCIENCE INTERNAL COMMITTEE</h4>
                                    <p>The Science Internal Committee is valuable in creating a science identity. This committee has the opportunity to plan a wide variety of events appealing to many different interests of science students. By focusing on providing a diversity of events for students, it allows them to engage within the faculty. I will work on creating more events such as an Art and Wine night or exam tea and coffee breaks, and bring back Kill the Keg. In addition, these events can be better promoted and organized via collaboration with different departments and portfolios within SUS. For example, collaborating with the VP Sustainability to create Make Your Own Hummus or Beeswax, or with the department of Chemistry to create a Cool Experiment Night. </p>
                                    <h4>SCIENCE GAMES</h4>
                                    <p>As Science Games is the second-largest event under this portfolio, it is important in creating a sense of community for the 800+ participants. This year, I will include more non-drinking games and celiac options to increase inclusivity. Additionally, I will add more activities during night events to increase participation. Finally, I will ensure that beaker orders are put in earlier so that they arrive BEFORE science games, thus promoting sustainability and giving everyone a unique take home. Distantly related, I believe in reducing the VIP culture that exists during Science Games and ensuring that all committee members and participants are feeling included.</p>
                                    <h4>AUS X SUS GRAD BALL</h4>
                                    <p>Given this event is the final hurrah at McGill for most people, I want to ensure as many people get the opportunity to partake in Grad Ball. I will do this by looking into new ticketing websites to replace Tickettailor which consistently crashes, removing the tier system so that everyone has equal opportunity and reducing confusion about ticket availabilities, and exploring new venue options that allow for a higher capacity. Additionally, as these tickets are very expensive, I would want to include non-drinking tickets for those who wish to attend the event as dry participants, and create alternative payment methods/bursaries so that tickets are more accessible.</p>
                                    <h4>ACCESSABILITY</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        With every event, anyone, regardless of barriers, should be able to attend.This year, I will ensure that a focus is placed on considering this while planning these events. With regards to physical accessibility, I will provide layouts for each event, and ensure that venues are picked with accessibility in mind, including wheelchair ramps, gender-less washrooms, and information on light and sound intensities. Regarding financial accessibility, I will work with the VP Finance to discuss bursaries or alternative payment methods which make the steep prices of events such as frosh, science games, and grad ball difficult to attend. Finally, I will ensure that resources are clearly communicated to participants before events. These include resources available outside of events such as for physical and mental health and sexual violence, and those available at the event such as Red Frogs, Walksafe, and MSERT.    
                                    <br>
                                    I also think it is imperative that the process of the Involvement Restriction Policy is made clear to participants beforehand. This ensures that if the situation arises there is a clear understanding of how to begin the IRP process and what it entails. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>SUSTAINABILITY</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        In the past year, environmental sustainability has taken a new focus at McGill and I believe it is important to reflect these values in many of the events. During frosh, we will no longer print the pamphlet as it is accessible online and on an app. Additionally, at Frosh and Science Games, a greater push will be made to include frosh mugs/beakers at events instead of the plastic single-use cups. The carbon footprint that these large scale events create cannot be ignored. As such, we will include a carbon offset cost within the tickets for Frosh, Science Games, and Grad Ball. The carbon offset gets donated to the Carbonfund.org Foundation which works to directly offset the carbon footprint. With every event in this portfolio, taking steps towards making them more sustainable is an important part of my platform.
                                    </p>
