											<h1>Jared Warden-Joseph</h1>
											<p>Running for VP Internal</p>
										</header>
                                            <p>
                                                Hi everyone! My name is Jared Warden-Joseph and I’m excited to be announcing my candidacy for the position of VP Internal of the Science Undergraduate Society in the upcoming election for the 2020-2021 school year! I am currently a U2 Anatomy and Cell Biology student from Montreal. Since coming to McGill, I have been extensively involved in the Internal portfolio due to my passion for event planning, my love for the Faculty of Science and my deep desire to allow everyone in the faculty to bond and simply have a good time. I have been a part of each of the four committees under the Internal portfolio which are listed below and thus believe that I have the experience and the know how to be a great Internal. In addition to my experience serving on these committees, I believe that I have the qualities to not only be a good VP Internal, but also a good SUS Exec.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>As you will see in my platform, I am running with the goal of being as inclusive, safe, accountable, sustainable, and approachable as possible in the upcoming year so as to create a loving culture and a sense of community within the faculty! Let’s work together to make sure that next year will be a year to remember!
                                             </p>

                                        <h2>Long Platform</h2>
                                    </header>
                                    <h4>INCLUSIVITY & EQUITY</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        I strongly believe that each and every person should be able to access and feel safe in all events planned by the SUS. Certain things have been done in recent years to increase both the inclusivity and equity of events, but I would like to go even further. I believe that this could be done in many ways. For example, by further increasing the understanding of consent for frosh leaders during training , they would better be able to explain the importance of it to their froshies and remove the discomfort around it.  On another note, adding or altering frosh events so that frosh has less of a focus on drinking would allow for everyone to feel included and actually be interested in events. Frosh should be an event tailored to facilitate positive interactions within the university and not promote drinking culture. I would also like to increase outreach and participation throughout the faculty. One example of this is making interest groups for science games teams even more accessible to all science students allowing for the whole faculty to benefit from amazing events. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>SAFETY</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        The safety of participants of SUS events and the maintenance of a safe McGill environment is paramount to anything else in the internal portfolio. The best way to ensure that participants feel safe and are as safe as possible is to have both the SUS Involvement Restriction Policy (IRP) and Interfaculty IRP enforced to the fullest. In their current form both policies are unclear and ambiguous. For example, when reading the Interfaculty IRP, it is unclear which faculty Complainants are supposed to file their complaint with. My goal would be to work with the SUS equity commissioners and the VP Internals/VP Socials of other Faculties to change this and to make them as survivor-centric as possible. It is also important to note that the policies’ goal should not be to punish Respondents but to protect Complainants and other McGill students. The translation of both policies to French would also be necessary. 
                                    </p>
                                        
                                    <h4>ACCOUNTABILITY</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        I believe that all SUS Execs should be accountable for the decisions that they make so as to be able to justify actions or decisions. My hope is that this would increase the sense of trust constituents feel in their leadership. In terms of the role of VP internal, one way to be more accountable is to make sure that an equity commissioner is present at all of the interviews for committees under the Internal portfolio. Nepotism and favouritism would thus be non-existent in the selection processes and allow for greater diversity of the student body to be involved in committees. 
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>SUSTAINABILITY</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Each and every event planned by the SUS has an immense carbon footprint and I believe that strides should be made so as to reduce it as much as possible. This can be done by using more sustainable companies when purchasing materials, be it science games shirts or frosh mugs or by not printing anymore Frosh booklets and moving to apps.
                                    </p>
                                        
                                    <h4>APPROACHABILITY</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        As an SUS Exec, one of the biggest roles of VP Internal is to be the voice of all SUS members. Thus as Internal I pledge to be as approachable as possible at all times. I will do my best to provide as many opportunities for feedback on events or for just a chat. This could be through more feedback forms or just having more office hours. I would also encourage people to message me with any problems they may have. My goal is for all of you to feel heard and listened to and feel like you can and want to come up to me for anything! I believe that, in a sense, more approachability is a form of giving the power back to you!
                                    </p>
                                    <p> 
                                        I want you all to know that I am running simply because I care. I care about each and every one of the people that come to the events planned by the SUS  and I care that each and every person has as much of a good time as possible because I know that everyone deserves it! Thank you so much for reading and please don’t forget to vote from March 12th-17th!
